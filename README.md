# Shopify-ProductReviews

- Navigate to Shopify Admin Panel
- Click on Online Store - Themes
- Under your current theme click on the Actions button
- In the dropdown click edit code

In the code editor, navigate to the template file that makes changes to your product detail pages. Paste the code found in the "Catalog + Widget Installation" File

In the same template file, place the <div> found in the "Widget Display" file where you want the widget to render on your page. We recommend near the title or add to cart button.
